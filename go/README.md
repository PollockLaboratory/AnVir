# AnVir
This is the refactored version of David's code taken from Dropbox (21st March 2022).

This module contains 6 packages:
 - 2 libraries: globals and seqmer
 - 3 command line tools: haploscan, hapcombos and tagvars
 - 1 external library: bit. This is an external module that appears to be copied and pasted into this project.
 
I have got all the package dependancies setup so that packages can call functions form one another.
However, I have not been able to get the command-line programs to run and some don't compile.
Some are missing the example input datasets, some appear to have function calls that are missing arguments.
